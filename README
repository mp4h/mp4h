                      ----------------

   Mp4h is a text processor specially designed for HTML documents.
   It has two ancestors: Meta-HTML <URL:http://www.metahtml.org/>
   and GNU m4 <URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>. The former
   inspired mp4h syntax whereas source code is derived from the
   latter.

   Mp4h syntax is immediately familiar to HTML programmers. Users
   can define their own tags, and programming constructs like loops,
   arrays, conditionals make mp4h very powerful.
